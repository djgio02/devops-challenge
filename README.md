# DevOps Challenge
This was a challenge interview for a senior devops position.

In this task, you'll write code that provisions a web server and database to the cloud. We will be looking at your skills in the following areas: 
- setting up infrastructure from scratch, 
- approaching a problem, and 
- documenting your solution.

This is a timeboxed task so feel free to explain tradeoffs, or how you would improve aspects of the solution given more time.

## Technical Test

### Instructions

 - Provision a web server and SQL database to the cloud using infrastructure as code
 - The application needs to be reachable from the internet
 - The database needs to be reachable from the application
 - The deployment needs to be highly available (HA), multiple zones or regions
 - Write documentation which provides a clear way to recreate your setup and test the application is running correctly

### Tools
 - Pick any web server, as long as it can respond to HTTP requests on port 80 or 443
 - Pick any SQL database
 - The cloud infrastructure provider can be either Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or Amazon Web Services (AWS)
 - Use any configuration management tool

### Bonus points

 - Use some of the current tools we use: Terraform, Kubernetes
 - Emphasize readability, maintainability, security, and DevOps methodologies.
 - As this is timeboxed, explain tradeoffs you made in these areas and how they could be improved.
